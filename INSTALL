1. Introduction
---------------------------
This is a more detailed installation instruction than found in the "README"
file. It is parted into mainly two sections (beside this intro): The next
section is intended to carry "first time" users through the installation
process. These are users which are asumed to have never compiled/ installed
something using the "GNU build system". Therefore this section will contain
very much details about how to configure the build system, start it and in the
end, install the results of the build process. The second part is intended as a
guide for developers, on how to use this directory tree for conributing to the
project. But this part is rather short, explaining only how to invoke all the
little helpers in standard developing tools. A more detailed description of the
developing system can be found in the documentation.
