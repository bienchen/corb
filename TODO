Build system
------------

- write perl script to assure m4macro style:
  - a) all m4files 2lines start, 2 lines end, 2 lines inbetween?
  - b) m4 style: first line macro name -> ---- -> macro name + params,
     gap between name and paren
  - c) all unterstriche bei m4 same length as function name + params?
  - d) params quoted/ unqouted? --> look up in Doku
  - indentation
  - spellcheck
  - optional args to macros: in []
  - emacs stuff: put to authors & versioning
  - space inbetween macros: 2 lines
  - paramnames in text quoted (interactive mode?)

- make distclean in share/misc/bin doesn't work properly
- add conditonal compilate to cleanfiles? Just to clean them on every make
  clean? --> if var given {everything OK} else {add to cleanfiles}
- spellcheck on m4 files, bootstrap, makefile.ams, configure.ac, config.h.in
- README @ libfallback: Take out dummy.c
- option for all optimisations/ speedups enabled
- style of compilation: [bla], switch to use traditional
- check libmath-values in crb_check_libmath.m4 for darwin! Could it be that
  nothing is needed here, because with macosx libmath is always invoked? Ask
  Jens
- fix size_max check in darwin
- write workaround for assert.h, only needed if set?
- Applications: all stable ones enabled by default, devel branch off by
  default, first devel app enabled, enables devel app branch
  instad of packages: --with-app-brot, create own group: apps in the corb?
- just saying "bootstrap" on darwin creates src/config.h.in
- use AC_DIAGNOSE and $0 to direct developer to the right syntax for own maros?
- with-app without-app, with-all-dvl-apps... functionaliyt in configure script.
  stuck at: AC_LIBSOURCE, source file not conected to library
- Derive Makefiles from configure.ac
# bootstrap:
#   - fill most of the vars from configure.ac
#     - check under which circumstances aclocal.m4 is updated
#       - just changes in configure.ac? yes
#       - changes in the macro files? no
#       - on new files in macro dir? no
#       - only on configure.ac if new macros from macro dir included? no
- why isn't --enable-development expanded by tab?
- configure option --enable-devel-tools (put to --enable-dev)


Emacs
-----
- Add own m4 macro names for highlighting?
- look in elisp file for what todo

Implementation
--------------
- all code with emacs versioning
- bug mesg function
- unlink errormsgs with lines from NDEBUG
- memmgr: Check for double frees:
          - on free, set file&line
          - on free, set flag "deleted" (bool: true/ false)
          - on second free: throw error with file&line
          - circumvent: set pointer to NULL after free
          Since malloc(0) allocates 1 byte, register this case in memmgr
          Rpl_malloc
          - include functionallity of rpl_mallox/ rpl_realloc in memmgr
            --> with rebuilding AC_FUNC_MALLOC
          Set up test for xmalloc2d in memmgr
- re-read when to use #include <> and #include ""
- give each class (datatype) a sizeof member? -> probably not because
  externally only handled as pointer
- change names of array to plural
- give all external function declarations the prefix extern
- remove variable names from external declarations

libs:
libcrbalpha ->  alphabets
              - predifined DNA, RNA, Protein
              - general approach
              - also for compression?
array stuff: Create internal array class via macros, void* array class/
             array class with unions for base types?

Files
-----
- project files (README, INSTALL...)
  - check newlines between licence and test and elisp parts

Roadmap
-------
- GPLify
- fix build system
  - make distclean
  - bootstrap -b
  - try configure & build on different systems
  - try `make dist` and check on different systems
  - add doxygen support? (just for tryout?)
- Extend documentation by saying whether a function throws an error message or
  not
- check which return values can be const, e.g. char*
- uniform naming scheme for internal functions -> istr_ but error_internal???
- Messaging functions: Rename module, format message to fit in Terminal
- adopt string class into existing classes/ modules
  - errormsg -> progname
  - check other modules
- fix test modules
  - no output while testing
  - informative error messages
- export check for config.h into header
- output of size_t via (unsigned long) %lu?
- arg parser
- check for more GCC keywords in the code
- invoke librtbfallback
