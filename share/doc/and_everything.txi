When dealing with RNA secondary structures, you will sooner or later stumble
upon Vienna strings. Such strings represent the base pairs of a 2D structure as
a concatenated collection of @samp{(}, @samp{)} and @samp{.}:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@samp{(} marks the 5' base of a base pair

@item
@samp{)} marks the 3' base of a base pair

@item
@samp{.} describes an unpaired base
