                   How to GPLify Your Contribution to CoRB

                               1. Introduction
                             -------------------

This document only describes the technical details on how to put your
contribution to CoRB under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
For philosophic issues, etc. please refer to
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html.

An ideal contribution to CoRB should consist of two components: Code and
documentation. Since source code is usually the larger part, we start
describing how to fit your code under the GPL. Thereafter we provide an
instruction for your documentation. But before everything else, a few notes on
a more general issue in licensing and copylefting...



                             2. After Many Years
                           -----------------------

Both, documentation and source code files need a copyright line somewhere near
the top. The note should be of the following form:

<snip>
Copyright (C) (years) (Your Name)
<snip>

Thereby the list of years shows the dates on which versions of a file were
completed, not released. An example would be the following scenario: You finish
a new version of a software on Dec 31 2007 but release it on Jan 1 2008. The
copyright line should then contain 2007, not 2008. Of course this is a little
bit complicated but required  by international copyright law. 



                             3. GPLify Your Code
                           -----------------------

To put your code under the GPL, each file has to contain a legal notice, saying
that it is covered by the GPL. This includes all source files: Lisp, C, Perl,
M4, Shell, makefile.am's, ....

For the notice, just copy the following to the top of all source files:

<snip>
Copyright (C) (years) (Your Name)

This file is part of CoRB.

CoRB is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

CoRB is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with CoRB.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<snip>

Additionally you should place your name and a working email address in the
AUTHORS file. You will find this file in the top-level directory of the CoRB
projects.

If you modify an existing file, just say so in the file itself. The note should
also contain the date of change. On major changes, discuss with the original
author if she agrees in sharing the copyright. Notes about changes should go
right after the license disclaimer.

Copying code from other projects covered by the SAME license should be OK in
principle. Please note that you have to include the copyright notice of the
foreign code in your file. All copyright notices should be gathered right near
the top of the files.

Beside the license notes in the code, your program should advertise the fact
that it is free software. Also it should inform the user that there is no
warranty. A standard way of doing this is to make your program output this
notice when it is passed the --version command-line flag. The notice should
look like this:

<snip>
(program name) (version)
Copyright (C) (years) (Your Name)
(program name) comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
For more information about license issues, see the file named COPYING.
<snip>

Since your program is not a single binary, you can omit the redistribution note
of most GNU software. This message will be included in the CoRB binary.

NOTETOMYSELF: Include redistribution (see emacs --version) note in CoRB
              --version



                         4. GPLify Your Documentation
                       --------------------------------

All your code documentation is already covered by the GPL if you include the
note in the source files. But manuals will be distributed in "compiled" form,
that is as pdf, html, .... Of course such a document does not contain the
copyright notes from the source files. Therefore you should explicitly put them 
under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL). For more information on this
license refer to http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html. Basically, to use the
GFDL with your document, you have to include a copy of the license in the
document and put the following note right after the title page:

<snip>
Copyright (C)  (years) (Your Name).
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
Free Documentation License".
<snip>

If you do not agree with the "Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, ..."
part, you may change it to something like:

<snip>
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
<snip>

The GFDL is used for the existing manuals/ guides.
