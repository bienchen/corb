@corb{} is an ever growing collection of tools for the analysis of
RNA molecules. This document is the developer's guide to @corb{}, not a user's
manual.



- Declare intention of this manual here:
  - This is a description of internals, conventions and how to change the code.
- manual for development in corb
- nothing on using corb

- tries to be holistic
- but: no anspruch to be free of errors
- on error: if kein bock to solve them, notify the author of this manual

- this manual is intended to be read, not to be ignored in large parts
- but: you must not read everything
- simple: if interest/ no knowledge: read
- if expert, e.g.@: in git, just check that your kowledge aggrees with the guide
- and: this is not a novel
- we try to concentrate on what is important for CORB
- not to enlight all aspects of techniques used/ systems, e.g.@: autoconf
- there are very good sources for most stuff in the net

- basically gegliedert in two parts:
  - general stuff
    - naming scheme
    - build system
    - using git
    - how to write manuals
  - api docu
    - c
    - perl
    - m4
