This directory contains the Emacs C syntax highlighting extensions and
skeletons for CoRB project.

For the syntax highlighting, just add the following to the .emacs, where
"HIGHLIGHT" is the extension you want to load and PATH points to the directory:

  ;; HIGHLIGHTS
(if (file-readable-p "PATH/corb/share/misc/emacs/HIGHLIGHT-font-lock-faces.elc")
  (load-library "PATH/corb/share/misc/emacs/HIGHLIGHT-font-lock-faces.elc"))

List of extensions
------------------


For access to the C source and header skeletons you first have to load "Emacs'
little helpers", a set of standard functions used by most of the Emacs
extensions. Therefore put the following into your .emacs, where PATH points to
the directory:


  ;; standard elisp functions for the whole dev-environment
(if (file-readable-p "PATH_TO_CORB_REPO/share/misc/emacs/emacs-l-helpers.elc")
    (load-library "PATH_TO_CORB_REPO/share/misc/emacs/emacs-l-helpers.elc")
  (progn
    (when (file-readable-p "PATH_TO_CORB_REPO/share/misc/emacs/emacs-l-helpers.el"))
    (load-library "PATH_TO_CORB_REPO/share/misc/emacs/emacs-l-helpers.el")))


Before loading the C extensions, you have to announce the project directory to
the emacs-l-helper library:


;;; set project root
(elh-set-project-tree-root "PATH_TO_CORB_REPO")


Now you can add loading of the C extensions to the .emacs:


;;; load Cs lil' helpers
(if (file-readable-p "PATH_TO_CORB_REPO/share/misc/emacs/c-l-helpers.elc")
    (load-library "PATH_TO_CORB_REPO/share/misc/emacs/c-l-helpers.elc")
  (progn
    (when (file-readable-p "PATH_TO_CORB_REPO/share/misc/emacs/c-l-helpers.el"))
    (load-library "PATH_TO_CORB_REPO/share/misc/emacs/c-l-helpers.el")))


For the C skeletons you can enable the auto-insertion feature of Emacs.
This will insert the skeletons in source and header files, when you are
visiting an empty file with extension ".c" or ".h". Just add the following to
.emacs:


;;; auto-insert for c-source & header files
(require 'autoinsert)
(auto-insert-mode 't)

;(setq auto-insert-query nil) ;; Uncomment if you don't want to be prompted
(define-auto-insert "\\.c$" 'c-source-skeleton)
(define-auto-insert "\\.h$" 'c-header-skeleton)

At least with linux there is one problem. Some methods to create new files
automatically add a newline or a whitespace to it. This will not be recognised
as an empty file be emacs. As a workaround we proved an Emacs advice for the
auto-insert function. It can be activated with the following line in the Emacs
configuration file:


(ad-activate 'auto-insert)


# Local variables:
# eval: (add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'time-stamp)
# time-stamp-start: "Last modified: "
# time-stamp-format: "%:y-%02m-%02d.%02H"
# time-stamp-end: "$"
# End:
