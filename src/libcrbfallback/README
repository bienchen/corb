1. Purpose of libcrbfallback
---------------------------
I.O.U. an explaination what's that fuzz all about.



---------------------------
2. Library header
---------------------------
libcrbfallback has no own library header. Since the library only provides
fallback/ replacement functions for special cases, using one cumulative header
could lead to problems, e.g. unwanted side effects. One example is the function
snprintf: The mprintf module of libcrbbasic holds a replacement for this
function and disables the use of it in other parts of the project. If we had a
library header for libcrbfallback it would include snprintf.h and provide the
original snprintf function to all including modules.
